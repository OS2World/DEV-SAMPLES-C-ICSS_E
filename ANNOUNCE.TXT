IBM Continuous Speech Series Speech Recognition
Developers Toolkit and Runtime System Software
 
The IBM Continuous Speech Series is a set of programs that consist of a toolkit
for developing speech enabled applications and a runtime for execution and
operation of those applications.  The developers toolkit provides the necessary
tools for application programmers to speech enable their existing products or
develop new applications which exploit speech recognition.  Using the speech
recognition Application Programming Interface (API), developers can produce
applications that recognize and process a continuous flow of spoken U.S.
English words.  Using ICSS can help the user to enhance the functionality of
many software applications and to develop new software applications that meet
the dynamic needs of today's markets.
 
The IBM Continuous Speech Series for Windows will be available through a beta
program starting on July 23, 1993.  The initial release of the ICSS for
Windows(1) program will allow Windows application developers to speech enable
Windows applications running in the WIN-OS2 box of OS/2(R) 2.1.  Customers must
complete the membership application form and return it, along with payment, to
receive the beta code, documentation and technical support.  This application
is available by calling 1-800-627-8363 and asking for an ICSS information
package.
 
The main features of ICSS are:
 
o  Speaker Independence -- Though there are variations in human speech from
   person to person, ICSS has the capability to process speech from different
   speakers.  In addition, ICSS requires no speaker enrollment or training,
   unlike some other speech recognition systems.  ICSS has been tested with a
   wide variety of speaking accents.  With experience, users learn appropriate
   microphone positioning and speaking volumes so that recognition rates
   improve with repeated speaker use.
 
o  Continuous Speech -- Continuous speech is a series of spoken words without a
   requirement for pauses between words.  This feature provides the ability for
   users to speak at natural or even rapid rates and enjoy successful speech
   recognition.  This capability is well suited for command and transaction
   applications that require high-speed control of user interfaces.
 
o  Large Vocabulary -- The ICSS dictionary has over 20,000 U.S. English words.
   The development tools are provided to allow application developers to add
   industry specific words.  ICSS can provide recognition under multiple,
   switchable, contexts of up to 1,000 words each.  By using the context
   switching feature, multiple contexts can be pre-loaded and rapidly switched,
   thus extending the practical reach of the system to complex real world
   applications.
 
o  Multi-Platform -- ICSS currently supports the OS/2, AIX(R) and Windows 3.1
   environments along with many of the popular sound boards such as
   Soundblaster and Pro Audio Spectrum 16.
 
o  Client/Server Support -- The recognition server can support multiple
   applications running on the same machine.  The recognition engine serves as
   a serially reusable resource.  The ICSS Runtime can be installed as either a
   stand-alone executable, as a server or as a client.  When installed in
   client/server mode, thus requiring 2 licenses, the client hardware resources
   in terms of memory requirements can be reduced.
 
o  Published APIs -- Documented APIs facilitate the efficient speech enablement
   of new and existing applications.  The API set gives the application
   developer an efficient method of utilizing the speech recognition engine.
   The advantages and flexibility of a continuous speech interface can be
   quickly applied to a broad spectrum of existing user applications in a
   manner that protects and enhances user software investment.

DESCRIPTION
 
SPEAKER INDEPENDENT SPEECH RECOGNITION
 
Though there are variations in human speech from person to person; ICSS has the
capability to process speech from different speakers.  In addition, ICSS
requires no speaker enrollment or training, unlike some other speech
recognition systems.  The IBM Continuous Speech Series has been tested with a
wide variety of speaking accents from around the world.  Though performance
varies somewhat, many accents are well recognized also, ICSS recognition rates
improve with repeated speaker use.
 
Business Solutions
 
Enable Customer's Competitive Advantage:  The speaker independent aspects of
ICSS, coupled with it's continuous speech functions and vocabulary size provide
an unparalleled speech recognition system.
 
Speaker independent speech recognition allows a wide range of customers to take
advantage of an application without having extensive computer skills.  ICSS now
expands the computer user interface to provide the next generation of
human/computer interaction.  Almost anyone that can speak US English, can use a
speech enabled application developed using the IBM Continuous Speech Series.
 
CONTINUOUS SPEECH RECOGNITION
 
Users can speak at natural, or even rapid, rates and enjoy successful speech
recognition.  This capability is well suited for command and transaction
applications that require high-speed control of user interfaces.  Natural
speech can now drive your applications.  Users can speak naturally and
continuously without pausing between words.
 
End User Productivity
 
Improved Worker Productivity:  Continuous Speech recognition can greatly
improve transaction speed because most people can speak faster than they can
type or press function keys on a computer.  This quick turnaround time for
transaction processing can increase thruput by decreasing the amount each
transaction takes to process.
 
Business Solutions
 
Enable Customer's Competitive Advantage:  Continuous Speech input as a means of
speech recognition software plays a key role for speech enabled applications.
Continuous speech being the natural method of communication can provide a
competitive advantage over applications speech enabled with discrete speech or
not speech enabled at all.  Discrete speech, or having to pause between words
is an unnatural act and can cause strain for the user.
 
Medium Vocabulary:  The IBM Continuous Speech Series has a 1,000 word active
vocabulary.  ICSS recognizes more than 1,000 words per context.  More complex
applications can be supported with multiple 1,000 word contexts that can be
rapidly switched so that the effective vocabulary is much higher than 1,000
words.  Often, you can develop contexts for different screens of an
application.  Then, contexts are switched almost instantaneously as users
progress through the program screens.
 
Growth Enablement
 
Increased Capacity/Performance Improvement:  The instantaneous context
switching provides the ability to have smaller contexts, thus improving speed
and accuracy of the speech enabled application.
 
Large Dictionary Base:  The ICSS Dictionary currently has over 20,000 words,
with phonemic representations, available for building contexts.
 
Systems Management
 
Improved Application Quality:  A multitude of applications can be speech
enabled with ICSS due to the robustness of the dictionary as well as the
ability to add specific words with the tools provided.

Limitations:  The IBM Continuous Speech Series can provide the tools necessary
to speech enable applications where US English is the language enabled.
However, the phonemes shipped with ICSS can be parsed to build grammars so that
other languages are supported.
 
  An example of this is "RETURN TO THE MAIN MENU"
 
  VOLVER_AL_MENU_PRINCIPAL

TERMS AND CONDITIONS
 
Licensing:  This Licensed Program will be available on a one-time charge basis
to Personal Computer Dealers, Industry Remarketers -- Personal Computer and
Software Dealers, offered for remarketing under the terms and conditions of the
IBM Business Partner Agreement.
 
This program is licensed under the terms and conditions of the IBM Program
License Agreement (PLA) (Z125-3301).  A copy of the PLA is packaged and shipped
with each program.  The diskettes are in a sealed envelope inside the package
and requires the end user to break the envelope seal.  This constitutes
acceptance of the PLA.  No signature is required.
 
IBM has acceptance terms for Additional License Copies for this program.  Under
these terms, customers may now acquire additional licenses for this program by
ordering a "Proof of Additional License" certificate.  The new "Proof of
Additional License", which is in the form of a certificate, is the customer's
authorization to make a single copy of the program.  The certificate may be
ordered in any quantity.  The customer must have obtained an original program
package in order to acquire additional licenses.  The terms and conditions of
the IBM Program License Agreement supplied with the original program package
apply to the Additional License Copies, except that the additional licenses may
not be transferred.  There is no machine readable code included with the new
"Proof of Additional License" package.
 
Customers now have a choice of acquiring additional licenses with the new Proof
of License certificate or by accepting the terms for Additional Licenses Copies
in the existing agreements (IBM Customer Agreement, IBM Customer Agreement --
License or End User Additional License Agreement).
 
Returns:  If the PLA package has been opened, but the diskette seal has not
been broken, the remarketer must accept the package and refund the money paid
to the end user.  These packages may be returned to IBM under the returns
provisions.
 
30-Day Money-Back Guarantee:  IBM will provide a credit for any program package
returned to its point of acquisition, provided it was acquired in the 30 days
prior to the date of return and includes the accompanying documentation and
media.
 
Upon receipt of the program package the remarketer will sign the Request for
Credit for Returned Licensed Program (Z125-4830) certifying that the program
package and its accompanying documentation and media was destroyed.  The
Request for Credit for Returned IBM Licensed Program may be obtained from the
local IBM office.
 
To obtain credit for the returned program package, the remarketer must submit
the end user's sales receipt or invoice, a copy of the IBM invoice and the
Request for Credit for Returned Licensed Program, signed by the remarketer and
send to the IBM TCS processing location.
 
The return credit will be processed upon receipt of the above.  The credit will
be based upon level II pricing.
 
Price Reduction Credit:  This product is not eligible for full inventory price
reduction credit.
