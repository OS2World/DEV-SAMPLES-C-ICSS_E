IBM Continuous Speech Series (ICSS) is a continuous speech, speaker
independent speech recognition system that runs on OS/2 and AIX.
ICSS runs on 486DX machines, and supports multiple sound boards, including
IBM M-ACPA, ProAudio Spectrum, and SoundBlaster.  ICSS is a development tool
which you use to speech-enable applications.  It consists of 12 API calls, packaged
in a DLL.  Find out more about ICSS by reading the article in the OS/2 Developer
magazine, July/August issue.   A Windows version of ICSS was announced at PC Expo,
and will be generally available in December, 1993.  

 This document is a complement to the OS/2 Developer Magazine article
 in the July/August 1993 issue entitled "Speech Enabling Your Application
 with ICSS" on page 83.

 Included with this package are two files: RECO.C and RL.BNF.
 RECO.C is the example program described in the article.  RL.BNF is an
 example of an input file to the context build process.  Please note
 that these files are intended as examples and are written for clarity
 and not robustness.
